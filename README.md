#Add Henshall/Heisig/Skip-Code Info a.k.a. tehInfo

##Description
Helps putting kanji info to anki cards by adding a menu entries to add RTK indices or keywords, or Henshall's "A Guide To Remembering Japanese Characters" indices, or Skip-Codes to quickly find in a dictionary.



##Usage
To add info to cards, select the cards in the browsing page in anki. Then select the info to add from the menu: Edit -> Add TehInfo -> (info to add).

##Customize
It's fairly straightforward to add not-included info to cards with this add-on. You just need to add the .tsv (tab separated values) file to the info folder and add the name of the info (or title or whatever) to the "sources" map in the "addtehinfo . py" file.

##Support
For questions, problems, or suggestions please file an issue at github.
